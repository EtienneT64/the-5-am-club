# The 5am Club Android Application

## My first android application created using Kotlin and Firebase

The 5am Club is a database-driven android application for fitness. It was built
using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase. The app is online only and requires
an internet connection. The app is conceptual and allows the user to join a
selection of clubs and view predefined schedules for fitness events for The 5am
Club. The application allows the user to do the following:

- Sign Up with an account
- Login to be able to use the app
- View Profile page to see account details
- View the Home page to see a calendar of events and a selection of clubs
- View Workouts page to see various workouts
- View Utilities Page to use BMI calculator
